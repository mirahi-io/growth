# Digital Garden: Ghost theming

## Why Ghost

We tried setting up a local Ghost and creating a Ghost theme to check if it fulfils our requirement regarding the implementation of Mirahi's digital garden. Multiple factors were taken into account, such as ease of installation, ease of use for writers and developers, flexibility and extensibility. A comparison can be made to similar services (Wordpress, Medium).

## Team

The team was composed of : CÃ©line, Victor & Anthony.

## Difficulties

The difficulties in this project arise mainly from unknown (yet) techs like Handlebars and the opiniated theme framework, as well as what seems like limitations in configuration that can be worked around with custom Javascript (eg. having different logos for light and dark modes).

## Goal

We reached our goal of having a live Ghost instance on which we can publish posts under different formats, all of which could be seen on the blog with a theme consistant with Mirahi's existent visual identity.
