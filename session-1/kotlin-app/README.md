# Kotlin app

## Why Kotlin

We choose Kotlin because this language seems easy to learn. Our goal was to make a minimalist application : a todo list. This goal is achievable in one day and didnt require design.
Kotlin was also an opportunity to learn development, with a mobile app approach. 

## Team 

The team was composed of : Tim, Maxim and Arnaud.

## Difficulties

The starting point of this project was difficult simply because we get some trouble with git and Android Studio. 
We also have lack of programming experience but it was predictible.

## Goal

We reach ou main goal, the demo app is available as .apk file if you want to test it. 
The cheatsheet is basic but with this one you can have an approach on how similar is Kotlin to Javascript.
